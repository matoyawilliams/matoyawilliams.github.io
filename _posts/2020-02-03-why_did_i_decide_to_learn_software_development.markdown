"# Why did I decide to learn software development?"
I decided to learn software development, because I have always had a love for computers. I could never decide what I wanted to do when I "grew up", but after many years I chose software developement, because I love computers and I want a job that I feel will be high in demand in the future. I feel eventually the world is going to be ran by computers and the only jobs that will be available will be for people to program those computers to do the  jobs that they once had humans doing. I want more control over my job, and I feel that I will be able to work for myself and have more flexiblity. I want to be able to create software that will help make life easier for everyone. I want to be the next Linus Trovalds or Steve Jobs. I  I think because the times are changing everyone should have computer programming knowledge.
